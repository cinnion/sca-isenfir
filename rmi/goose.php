<h1>Red Mountain Goose</h1>

<!-- Content Begins Here -->

<p>This game is played on a spiral course of 63 spaces, consecutively numbered. Certain special-marked spaces add either a bonus or a penalty to a player's move. Any number of players can play. Each player needs a uniquely marked, colored or shaped playing piece. Each player places their single playing piece on the starting area. Each player rolls two dice, and the one rolling the highest number goes first, with play continuing to the first player's left. Each player will roll two dice and move that many spaces on the board, with the goal of reaching 63.</p>

<p>To win, the playing piece has to land on 63 exactly. If the number thrown is higher than necessary, the surplus is counted backwards from the number 63 space. If the backward move happens to land the piece on a special-marked point that "advanced" movement, the piece continues moving on backwards, instead. At the player's next turn, he could resume his forward movement.</p>

<p>Most of the special-marked points have a Red Mountain Goose (or simply, goose) on them, hence the name of the game (these spaces have a red, three-peak mountain on them with a goose hiding just behind the mountain). Landing on a goose allows the player to move his piece the same amount of the roll again, and continue doing such until he no longer lands on a goose. (i.e. If you rolled a 6 and by moving 6 spaces, you landed on a goose, you move 6 more spaces.) Because there is a goose on every multiple of nine, a throw of nine on the first roll would allow a player to advance immediately to space 63 and win, so a special rule was made. If a nine is rolled on the first throw, the player advances his piece to space 26 if the numbers on the dice were 6 & 3. If the numbers on the dice were 4 & 5, the piece advanced to space 53. From these spaces, the player would continue the game. If a player ends up back at the beginning again, however (either by being &quot;bumped&quot; or landing on Death), a roll of nine WILL advance the player immediately to to 63 and victory!</p>

<p>Other special-marked spaces have different effects:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>6</td><td>(Bridge)</td><td>Move to space number 12</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>(Inn)</td><td>Lose 2 turns (one drinking, one getting sober)</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>(Dice)</td><td>Placement of playing piece if player rolls 6 &amp; 3 on first roll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>(Well)</td><td>Lose 1 turn (getting a drink)</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>(Maze)</td><td>Go back to space number 30 (Got lost in maze)</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>(Prison)</td><td>Trapped until another player lands here.  Players then swap starting spaces like any other bump, and the new player is &quot;imprisoned&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>(Dice)</td><td>Placement of playing piece if player rolled 4 &amp; 5 on the first roll</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>(Death)</td><td>You died!  Go back to starting point and begin again!</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>(Victory)</td><td>Colleect the pot!  Must land exactly.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Pieces may pass other pieces. If a piece finishes its move on a space already the occupied by a second piece, the second piece is moved back to the space the first piece began its turn on. (i.e. If a player who has a piece on space 20 rolls a 4, he moves his piece to space 24. If space 24 has an opponent's piece on it, the opponents piece is moved back to space 20, and the player's piece remains on space 24.)</p>

<p>To enter the game, each player antes an agreed-upon amount into the center. Whenever a player lands on a Red Mountain Goose, they must pay a penny into the pot. If a player lands (OR REMAINS) on any other special-marked space, they must pay a penny to the house. For example, if a player lands on the Inn, they must pay a penny when they land, a penny on their first missed turn, and a penny on their second missed turn. A player stuck in prison may &quot;bribe the jailer&quot; an amount agreed to by the other players (it should be reasonably stiff) to get out. This money goes into the pot, (and a penny to the house) and the player may roll again on his NEXT turn. The first player to reach 63 exactly wins the entire pot.</p>
