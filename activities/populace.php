<!-- Content Begins Here -->

      <p>This is the group's chance each month to get together in its entirety 
        and discuss matters of general interest,  
        plan local events and activities, and receive officer reports about the 
        general goings-on of the group. The meeting is open to everyone, and everyone 
        is encouraged to come out and have a say in the affairs of the Shire. 
        It is the most &quot;mundane&quot; formal activity of the group, but it 
        is an excellent chance to get the full scoop on what is going on, who 
        is doing what, and what the plans for the group are.</p>

<p>Currently meetings are the second Tuesday of every month and the location is posted on the calendar. Contact <a href="mailto:theredbearded AT gmail.com">Matt Garland</a> for more information.</p>
