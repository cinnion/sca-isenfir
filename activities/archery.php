<h1>Archery and Thrown Weapons</h1>

<!-- Content Begins Here -->

<p>Isenfir gets together with Caer Gelynniog to practice archery and thrown weapons. </p>

<p>Archery uses standard long bows and thrown weapons include axes and knives.</p>

<p>New people are encouraged to come out and learn more.  No experience is necessary - we're happy to teach beginners.  Those with experience are also welcome.   We have loaner gear available for the use at practices.  </p>

<p>Currently practices are held on the 4th Sunday of each month starting at 1:00pm. Contact <a href="mailto:ggg9y AT virginia.edu">Garth Groff</a> for more information.</p>
