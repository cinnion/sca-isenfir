<h1>Welcome to Isenfir</h1>

<p>The Shire of Isenfir is the local group of the <a href="http://www.sca.org">Society for Creative Anachronism</a> (SCA) for the central Virginia area, including Charlottesville, Albemarle County, Nelson County, Waynesboro, Staunton, Harrisonburg, and Augusta and Rockingham Counties. The SCA is an international, non-profit, educational organization dedicated to the study and selective re-creation of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Members attend events where they wear period clothing and assume period personas in order to learn in a more firsthand way what some aspects of medieval life were like. The SCA holds numerous regional and local events, and most groups also have a variety of local activities, some &quot;in garb,&quot; some not.
