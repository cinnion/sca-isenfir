        <b><font size="3">(SAB, or Barn)</font></b></p>
      <p>The SAB (or &quot;Barn&quot;, as some call it) is located in the Carl 
        Smith Center area, next to the football stadium (Scott Stadium). There 
        is tons of parking right there. </p>
      <p><i><b>From North of Charlottesville</b></i>: Take Rt 29 South into Charlottesville. 
        Eventually you will see an overpass where, if you get on you will stay 
        on Rt 29 heading south, and if you continue straight you will be on Rt 
        29 Business (Emmet St). Keep going straight onto Emmet St. You will pass 
        through four lights and under a railroad underpass. At the fifth light 
        you will be at the intersection of Emmet St and Ivy Rd/University Ave. 
        There will be a Cavalier Inn/Best Western motel on your right and a Chevron 
        station on your left. Turn right onto Ivy Rd. Go to the first light which 
        is the intersection with Alderman Rd. There is St Mark's Lutheran Church 
        on the left and banks on the other three corners (One Valley, Crestar, 
        and Wachovia). Turn left onto Alderman Rd. Go through the first light, 
        which is at McCormick Rd, and you will soon pass the stadium on the left 
        (it's really big and stadium-like ... you can't miss it). After you pass 
        the stadium there will be a parking lot on your left. Turn into this lot. 
        The SAB is at the far end of the lot, opposite from the stadium. It is 
        rather squat and brown, is the only building in the area on that side 
        of the road, and has a big sign in front that says &quot;Student Activities 
        Building&quot;.</p>
      <p><b><i>From South of Charlottesville</i></b>: Take Rt 29 North toward 
        Charlottesville. Just after crossing under I-64, exit right onto 29 Business 
        and turn right at the bottom of the ramp. After you pass the Amoco Food 
        Shop, turn left at the first stoplight onto Maury Road. After a 4-way 
        stop, you will see the SAB on your right. See description above.</p>
      <p><b><i>From East or West of Charlottesville</i></b>: Take I-64 to exit 
        118B, which is Rt 29, headed north. Follow the directions above for &quot;From 
        South of Charlottesville.&quot; <br>
      </p>
