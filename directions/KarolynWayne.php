<p>
<b>131 Crompton Rd<br>
Waynesboro, VA<br>
</b>
</p>
<p><b>Directions:</b></p>
<p><b><i>From 64:</i></b><br>
Take exit 94, turn towards town. (Right for those from Charlottesville). 
Follow that road to the big intersection where you'll see Rite Aid, McDonalds, BP, Burger King, etc.
Turn Left onto Main st (250)
Make an almost immediate left (between Rite Aid & the church/Masonic temple) onto Dupont circle.
Follow the right fork of the road which is Crompton Road.
We are about 5 or so houses in on the right.  Look for a HUGE pine tree in the front yard and a lamppost with 3 lights (and of course, our big blue van)</p>
