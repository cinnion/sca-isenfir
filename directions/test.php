<b>703 St. Clair<br>
Charlottesville, VA <br>
434-293-8166</b>

<p><b>Directions:</b></p>

<p>Take I-64 to Charlottesville and get off on the Shadwell exit (Exit 124)<br>
At the bottom of the ramp, head west on Rte. 250<br>
Take 250 W through about 4 lights which will take you up and down Pantops Mountain. (Hill, really)<br>
At the bottom of the hill, you'll go over a bridge over the Rivanna River and turn left onto High Street at the next light.  (It's an odd intersection.  To the left it's High Street, to the right it's River Road.)<br>
Follow High Street up toward Martha Jefferson Hospital and turn right onto Hazel Street.  (It's about the fourth street up and has Riverside Lunch on the corner.) <br>
Take Hazel all the way up the hill until it T's into St. Clair Avenue and turn left onto St. Clair. 
<br>
We are at 703 St. Clair, about the... 6th? house down on the right.  It's a one-story, grey house with a small front porch and lots of red clay in the front yard.  Park anywhere as long as you don't block a neighbor's driveway.
