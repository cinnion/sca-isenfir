<p><b><font size="3">Christine Cooper and Daniel</font></b><br>
<b>1501 Lanetown Road<br>
Crozet, VA 22932 <br>
434-832-7733</b>
</p>
<p><b>Directions:</b></p> 

<p><b>From the west:</b><br>Take 250 East (I-64 exit #107) to Crozet.  Turn left at the light onto Rte 240/Miller School Road/Crozet Avenue north into "downtown" Crozet.  When you come to the one street light in Crozet, go straight, under the railroad tracks, til you come to the 4-way stop.  Turn left at the stop sign onto Railroad Ave.  Follow directions below from the ***.
</p>

<p><b>From the east:</b><br>Take 250 West past Ivy to where 250 and 240 meet.  Bear right to turn onto 240 and take it all the way into "downtown" Crozet.  You will eventually come to the 4-way stop.  Go straight through the stop onto Railroad Ave.</p>

<p>***  Follow Railroad Ave. down a couple of miles (watch your speed; the limit is 25 mph along there) with the railroad at your left.  When you get to the fork in the road, bear left.  That is Lanetown Road.  Go over the railroad track and make an immediate left onto the gravel drive.  (It is only a few feet past the railroad track.)  We are the second house down that drive.</p>
