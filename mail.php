<h2>Introduction to the Lists</h2>

<p>The Shire of Isenfir maintains two electronic mailing lists, one for group discussions and one for only announcements. These mailing lists are the primary means of communication for the group, and as such are very helpful in staying involved . The subjects of list messages include reminders about scheduled activities, last-minute site or time changes, general discussions of Shire policy, and links to useful information on the Web, as well as anything else members feel the need to discuss.</p>

<p>As stated above, there are TWO mailing lists for isenfir. The main list (isenfir AT virginia.edu) is for all general discussions that people want to have, and has an average message count of about 20-30 message per week (often fewer, occasionally more). The other list (isenfir-announce AT virginia.edu) is for announcements only, either reminders of scheduled events or information about time/site changes related to activities. This list has fewer than 5 messages per week, and is useful for those who just want to know what is going on without being involved in any general discussions. If you subscribe to the main list, you will be automatically subscribed to the announcements list as well. If you subscribe to only the announcements list, you will only receive mail for that list.</p>

<p>The scope of the general mailing list is not rigidly defined, and in general the members are not terribly picky about what you post, so long as it is in some way relevant to the group or at least a number of people within the group. Items to generally avoid, though, are chain letters, mundane politic issues or petitions (ones that don't impact the SCA or Isenfir in some way), virus warnings, and general commercial or non-commercial &quot;spam&quot;. Basically, before posting or forwarding something non-SCA, ask yourself if it is REALLY something EVERYONE on the mailing list will be interested in. And if it's something &quot;politically urgent&quot; or otherwise something you &quot;must forward immediately, to everyone you know, or else the world will end!&quot; please check out it's validity at one of the &quot;debunking&quot; sites listed below.</p>

<h2><a name="subscribe"></a>How to Subscribe</h2>
<P>Go to the Sympa mailing list server <A HREF="http://lists.virginia.edu">http://lists.virginia.edu</A><img src="images/external_link.gif" title="External Link" alt="External Link" /> and log in using your UVa computing ID (click the "NetBadge" button at the top left) or Non-UVa email address.</P>

<P>In the search field at the bottom of the Mailing List Categories block, enter "isenfir" (without quotes) and click the "Search Lists" block. This will bring up a list containing the "isenfir AT virginia.edu" and "isenfir-announce AT virginia.edu" mailing lists described above. Click the one you wish to subscribe to.</P>

<P>At the information page for the list you have chosen, click "Subscribe" near the bottom of the left-hand column. Please be patient as response on the server can be quite slow.</P>

<P>For assistance, questions or comments, please contact the list owner at <A HREF="mailto:hlf AT virginia.edu"> hlf AT virginia.edu</A> or <A HREF="mailto:webminister AT isenfir.org"> webminister AT isenfir.org</A>.

<h2><a name="debunk"></a>Debunking Urban Legends and Hoaxes</h2>

<p>It is an unfortunate fact that there are many, many false and misleading stories circulating via e-mail around the Internet. Some were originally well-intended, some were just jokes gone awry, and some are downright malicious. In most cases, the message will urge you to &quot;forward this message to everyone you know&quot; or something similar to ensure it's duplication. In general, do NOT forward messages to mailing lists that in any way appear to be chain letters or other messages designed to &quot;keep going&quot; (even the &quot;cute&quot; ones like &quot;send this message to 10 friends to let them know you love them, and you'll get lots of love in return&quot; ... if you want to send it to 10 personal addresses, that's your business, but DON'T send it to a mailing list). If you think the information in the message is just too important not to send to the mailing list, please verify it's authenticity before sending it. There really are LOTS of hoaxes out there, and they just keep going around and around so long as people forward them. The links below are to several sites that will help you determine the validity of a message. Please utilize them before forwarding any sort of &quot;warning&quot; or &quot;call to action&quot; to a mailing list, especially this one! </p>
